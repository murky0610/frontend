    duration: "June 1, 2024 - November 30, 2025",
    description:
      "The project aims to analyze the current logistical networks and resources for the timber supply chains in the Caraga and Davao Regions, and formulate an evidence-based strategic plan and policy frameworks for efficient logistical networks. It will map current networks, determine factors affecting logistics, analyze efficiency, identify areas for improvement, and provide policy recommendations. The AAVC lab facility will store the project database and support spatial analysis embedded in GIS and remote sensing tools.",

    duration: "March 1, 2022 - March 31, 2024",
    description:
      "The project developed a mobile traceability application for the tuna supply chain, incorporating food safety practices. It identified key data elements and critical tracking events with reference to BFAR standards. The app has been pilot-tested among fisherfolks and traders in Mati City, with 17 fishers actively recording tuna catch. The plan is to host the app, in collaboration with BFAR, to AAVC Lab.",

      "The project aims to develop and implement a Transparent Traceability System for cacao in Southern Philippines. It will design a distributed ledger technology traceability system, pilot-test methods for capturing key data elements, develop risk management strategies, build linkages across the supply chain, and institutionalize the implementation of the cacao traceability system. The AAVC Lab will link the traceability system to be developed.",

      "This project addresses the demand for verifiable sources of sustainably-raised, clean, and healthy shrimp through a blockchain-based traceability system. It will conduct a comprehensive value chain analysis, design blockchain architecture, implement a decentralized application through smart contracts, and conduct system tests. The AAVC Lab will link the traceability system to be developed in the Mindanao State University.",
